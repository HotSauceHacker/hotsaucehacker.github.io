## Understanding MITRE ATT&CK Part 1
MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base that contains a comprehensive list of tactics and techniques used by cyber attackers. It was developed by MITRE Engenuity, a non-profit organization that aims to solve complex problems for the public interest. The framework provides a standardized language for describing the actions and behaviors of cyber attackers.

In this article, we will cover the basic concepts of MITRE ATT&CK and how it can help you improve your organization's security posture.

Getting Started with MITRE ATT&CK
You can access the MITRE ATT&CK framework by visiting their website. One of the best ways to get started is by taking their Basic Course, which costs $299 for a year and includes certification tests. This course provides an in-depth overview of the framework and how to use it effectively.

Tactics, Techniques, and Sub-Techniques
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is organized into different levels of granularity. The top-level is tactics, which represent the overall goals that an attacker wants to achieve. The tactics are divided into 12 categories, including initial access, execution, persistence, and exfiltration.

Techniques, on the other hand, represent the specific actions that an attacker takes to achieve their goals. Each technique is identified by a unique T# ID number, and they are organized under their respective tactics. Techniques can be further broken down into sub-techniques, which provide a more granular description of the specific actions that an attacker takes. Sub-techniques are identified by a T#.### ID number.

Mitigations
Mitigations are configurations, tools, or processes that can prevent a technique from being successful. They are found at the bottom of a technique page and can be used to inform your organization's security controls.

Data Sources
Data sources refer to the types of information that can be collected by a sensor or logging system. They are essential for detecting and responding to attacks. MITRE ATT&CK provides a comprehensive list of data sources that can be used to identify specific techniques.

Detections
Detections are high-level analytic processes, sensors, data, and detection strategies used to identify specific techniques. They provide guidance on how to interpret and analyze data to detect and respond to attacks.

Procedures
Procedures describe the specific implementation of a technique or sub-technique used by an adversary. They provide insight into the groups or software entities that use the technique and how it is used.

Groups and Software
MITRE ATT&CK also provides a list of threat groups and software that are known to use specific techniques. This information can be used to inform threat intelligence and help identify potential attackers.

Mobile and Industrial Control Systems
MITRE ATT&CK has also built matrices for Mobile and Industrial Control Systems. These matrices provide a comprehensive list of tactics and techniques specific to those environments.

Contributing to MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK is a living framework, and the community is encouraged to contribute and add to it regularly. Think of it as a Wikipedia for security, where sharing and publishing information in a timely manner is critical.

To access the most up-to-date version of the framework, you can download the STIX, which is a JSON collection of the dataset on the website.

Conclusion
MITRE ATT&CK is a powerful tool that can help organizations improve their security posture by providing a standardized language for describing the actions and behaviors of cyber attackers. By understanding the basics of the framework and how to use it effectively, you can better detect and respond to attacks and ultimately protect your organization from cyber threats.
